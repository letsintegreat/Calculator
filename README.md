Attractive, isn't it?  
And yes, the background is also created by me. Thanks to [Gravit Designer](https://www.designer.io/).

And I think that everybody knows how a Calculator works, so it isn't required to explain its working.

Right now, This Calculator doesn't support decimal calculations, But That will be added soon!
